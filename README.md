📊 Project Title / Headline
Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard: Lending Performance Intelligence
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to explore loan origination, funding, risk segmentation, and borrower profiles—enabling financial institutions to monitor KPIs and uncover patterns in loan approval and repayment behavior.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose
The Bank Loan Report Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of loan application trends, funding performance, customer segmentation, and loan risk classification. With real-time filters and visual narratives, this tool helps loan officers, analysts, and policy teams make data-driven decisions on funding efficiency, bad loan minimization, and borrower profiling.

🧰 Tech Stack
Power BI Desktop – Core platform for visual reports and DAX-driven metrics.

Power Query – For importing and transforming large financial datasets.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculating KPIs such as MoM % change, interest averages, and risk distributions.

Data Modeling – Established relations between borrower info, loan stats, and risk classifications to allow slicing and comparative analytics.

File Format – .pbix for development; .png for presentation.

🗂️ Data Source Origin
Simulated loan dataset with 38.6K applications

Covers attributes like:

Loan Purpose, Grade, Sub-grade, State

Funded/Received Amounts, Interest Rate, Installments

Good vs Bad Loan status, Loan Term, Home Ownership

Monthly MoM trends and MTD aggregations

⭐ Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Banks and lenders often struggle to track loan risk, funding performance, and borrower segments at scale. Without centralized dashboards, monitoring month-on-month performance, identifying funding bottlenecks, or profiling high-risk applicants becomes difficult.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To offer loan teams a 360° view of lending performance that helps:

Identify trends in application volumes and funded amounts

Distinguish between good vs bad loans

Break down performance by geography, purpose, and borrower profile

Benchmark monthly efficiency and track loan product performance
